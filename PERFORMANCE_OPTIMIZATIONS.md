# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Movie App to improve loading times and user experience.

## üöÄ Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Loading for Images
- **Component**: `LazyImage.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Images only load when they enter the viewport
- **Benefits**: 
  - Reduces initial page load time
  - Saves bandwidth for users
  - Improves Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS)

### 2. Skeleton Loading States
- **Component**: `MovieCardSkeleton.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Shows animated placeholder content while data loads
- **Benefits**:
  - Better perceived performance
  - Reduces layout shift (CLS)
  - Improves user experience during loading

### 3. Intersection Observer API
- **Implementation**: Used in `LazyImage` component
- **Purpose**: Efficiently detects when elements enter viewport
- **Benefits**:
  - Better performance than scroll event listeners
  - Native browser API with good browser support

### 4. Loading State Management
- **Implementation**: Added `isLoading` state to all pages
- **Purpose**: Shows skeleton cards while fetching data
- **Benefits**:
  - Clear loading feedback
  - Prevents empty states during API calls

## üìä Performance Benefits

### Before Optimizations:
- All images loaded immediately on page load
- No loading feedback during API calls
- Potential layout shifts when content loads

### After Optimizations:
- Images load only when needed (viewport-based)
- Smooth skeleton loading animations
- Reduced initial bundle size impact
- Better Core Web Vitals scores

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### LazyImage Component Features:
```javascript
- Intersection Observer for viewport detection
- Smooth opacity transitions
- Fallback placeholder images
- Error handling for failed loads
```

### Skeleton Loading Features:
```css
- Shimmer animation effect
- Responsive design
- Matches actual content dimensions
- Smooth transitions
```

### Loading State Integration:
```javascript
- Added to all movie listing pages
- Conditional rendering of skeleton vs content
- Pagination hidden during loading
```

## üéØ Usage

The optimizations are automatically applied to:
- Movie cards in all listing pages
- Similar movies section
- Movie detail page images
- Cast member photos
- Backdrop and poster images

## üîß Configuration

### Lazy Loading Threshold:
- Default: 10% of image must be visible
- Configurable in `LazyImage.jsx`

### Skeleton Animation:
- Duration: 1.5 seconds
- Customizable in `index.css`

## üì± Browser Support

- **Intersection Observer**: Modern browsers (IE 11+ with polyfill)
- **CSS Animations**: All modern browsers
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for older browsers

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential additional optimizations:
1. Image compression and WebP format
2. Virtual scrolling for large lists
3. Service worker for caching
4. Preloading critical images
5. Bundle splitting and code splitting
